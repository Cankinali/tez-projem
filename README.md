AI-based anomaly detection system for Android malware
# Android Malware Detection using AI-Based Anomaly Detection

This project is a part of my undergraduate thesis and focuses on detecting Android malware using machine learning models. The system analyzes APK files and flags potential malicious behavior based on anomaly detection.

## Project Goals

- Detect Android malware using AI-based anomaly detection
- Use hybrid datasets from Drebin, CICMalDroid, AndroZoo, and VirusTotal
- Export trained models in ONNX format
- Integrate ONNX models into a real Android application for real-time testing
